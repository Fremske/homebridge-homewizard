# homebridge-homewizard

## Current supported devices:
- Switches
- Dimmers
- Thermometers
- Motion sensors
- Light sensors
- Window Covering (Somfy, HomeWizard, ASUN) (thanks to: ygageot)
- Philips HUE (thanks to: ygageot)
- Radiator Valves (thanks to: ygageot)
- Smoke sensors (thanks to: ygageot)
- Contact sensors (thanks to: ygageot)
- Heatlink (thanks to: ygageot)

## Install guide
First follow the instructions to install homebridge: https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge

If you have Node and NPM setup basically:
```bash
npm install -g homebridge
```

Once you have homebridge installed, install this plugin:

```bash
npm install -g homebridge-homewizard
```

Now you will have to setup your config.json for homebridge. An example
is included in this repo.

## Post install
When you have installed homebridge and homebridge-homewizard and got them running
and setup on your iOS device. All devices that homebridge-homewizard currently
supports should popup on your iOS device as accessories in Homekit.

## Config
Below is an example configuration for Homebridge. To run the HomeWizard plugin you need to add the
platform object in the platforms array like below. The accessories array, has not functionality
regarding the HomeWizard plugin and is used by Homebridge for other plugins etc.

Options:
- platform: should always be HomeWizard
- url: The url to your HomeWizard
- password: The password of your HomeWizard
- filtered(optional): Array of accessories that will be ignored by the plugin. If you have a switch in your
HomeWizard you don't want to expose to Siri. Put the name in here and it will be ignored.
- debug(optional): when set to true enables some extra logging regarding the http requests, usefull for debugging
- valves(optional): object mapping valve name to thermometer name, the valves supported by the HW don't have an temperature meter in them. By using a thermometer in the same room you can use them as a thermostat, if you don't specify a thermometer the currentTemperature reported by the valve will be the same as the set target temperature.
- heatlinks(optional): integer value with the duration (minutes) for your change of the target temperature with HeatLink. The default value is 60 minutes. If you choose 0 it will be an infinite duration.
- switchTypes(optional): by default the plugin will assume that switches are lightbulbs, which is the case for
a lot of people. This will cause Siri to turn of all switches when you see turn of the lights. If you have
switches that are not lights, here you can specify their type and Siri will treat them accordingly.
Available types are: fan, outlet, switch, lightbulb.
- createPresetSwitches (optional): create switches for the HomeWizard presets. Default is true.
- presetNames (optional): names used to create the preset switches. If not set in the config the default names will be used like in the example config.

      }
   }]
}
```

## Known issues
- When there are special characters being used in the password this might lead to problems connecting to the HomeWizard because of an encoding issue.

## FAQ
- How do I update to a newer version of the plugin?
Run the following command, with sudo if needed on your platform:
```bash
npm update homebridge-homewizard -g
```

- I'm having issues, now what?
Please make sure you are always running the latest version of the plugin by using the update command above.
If you still have issues, please file an issue on Github explaining the issue you are running into.


## Developing
All help developing this plugin is welcome. Homebridge-homewizard is written in ES6 and transpiled using Babel.
Code styles are evaluated using Eslint to make sure all code looks the same. If you need help to setup, let me know.

### Adding device support
If you want to add support for new devices, you will need to create a new accessory class in
the accessories folder. See for example [switch](src/accessories/switch.js) or [thermometer](src/accessories/thermometer.js). Next to that you will need to make
the accessories factory in `accessories.js` aware of you new device type. The factory receives the entire response of the get-sensors call from the HomeWizard which lists all devices.
